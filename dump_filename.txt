Open your eyes,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
(Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
