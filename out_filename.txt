(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let we go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let we go
(Let me go) (Never) let we go (Let me go) Ah
(Let me go) Will not let we go
(Let me go)(Never) Never let we go
Bismillah! No, we will not let we go
Didn't mean to make we cry,
Easy come, easy go, will we let me go
Gotta leave we all behind and face the truth
Open wer eyes,
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will we do the Fandango!
So we think we can love me and leave me to die
So we think we can stop me and spit in my eye
